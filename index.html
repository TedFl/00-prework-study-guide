<!-- <strong> makes my text bold! -->
<!-- <em> stands for emphasis - this makes my text italic -->
<!--do not use <b> and <i>-->

<!--We use <strong> and <em> instead of <b> and <i> because they are a visual representation with no meaning behind them.
  <b> and <i> are a visual representation of bold and italic but it doen't actually add importance and emphasis to my text.
  And this important because one of the thing we have to worry about with web design is accessibility. 

  They're going to be people who are visiting the website who might be using "scren readers" which read the website to them. 
  And <strong> and <em> tell the browser to add more importance and emphasis to our text -->

      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is used to create the stucture of a webpage.</li>
        <li>When we create the structure for our webpage, we used a series of HTML elements to define the content framework.</li>
        <li>The <strong>head </strong> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The <strong>body </strong> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>An HTML <strong>Attribute</strong> defines additional information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML Attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <strong>child element.</strong></li>
        <li>The element that holds all the children is knownn as the <strong>parent element.</strong></li>
        <li>In <strong>Semantic</strong> HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML elements make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
        <li>An <strong>element </strong> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
        <li>Elements give structure to the content on the webpage.</li>
        <li><strong>Tag</strong> refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</strong> is a programming Language used by developers to define how webpage is presented to users.</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: <strong>Inline CSS</strong>, <strong>Internal CSS Style Sheet</strong>, and <strong>External CSS Style Sheet</strong>.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use Inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Internal Style Sheet contains rules for webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.  </li>
        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an External CSS Style Sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>When using an External Style Sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
        <li>A <strong>margin</strong> indicates how much space we want arround the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A <strong>padding</strong> indicates how much space we want arround the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Git & GitHub</strong> is a version control software and cloud hosting service that let us keep track of changes we make to our code.</li>
        <li>To access Git use the command line.</li>
        <li>Git commands always start with <em>git</em> and are used to save and track version of your code.</li>
        <li>A <strong>branch</strong> is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on without affecting the default branch.</li>
        <li>Our <strong>default branch</strong> is called "main". We should'nt do any coding directly in the "main" branch.</li>
        <li>To make changes to the main branch. we should create a feature branch.</li>
        <li>A <strong>feature branch </strong> is a copy of the main branch.</li>
        <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all changes we make to the code while working.</li>
        <li><em>git status</em>: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li><em>git checkout -b branch-name</em>: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a high-level dynamic programming Language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Control flow</strong> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, the computer reads code from tor to bottom, or in a linear way.</li>
        <li>The order of the code affects the outcome. JS read from top to bottom, and order counts.</li>
        <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
        <li>A <strong>variable</strong> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>An <strong>array</strong> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
        <li>A <strong>for</strong> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perfom a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over an over.</li>
        <li>A <strong>function</strong> is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perfom a certain task.</li>
        <li>In order to use a function in JavaScript, we need to <em>define the function</em> and then we must <em>call the function</em> for the function to execute.</li>
