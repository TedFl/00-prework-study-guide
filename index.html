      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the stucture of a webpage.</li>
        <li>When we create the structure for our webpage, we used a series of HTML elements to define the content framework.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>An HTML Attribute defines additionla information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML Attributes are always defined in the begining elemt, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child element.</li>
        <li>The element that holds all the children is knownn as the parent element.</li>
        <li>In Semantic HTML elements , the name of the element describes its content an the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML elements make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
        <li>Elements give structure to the content on the webpage.</li>
        <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a programming Language used by developers to define how webpage is presented to users</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
        <li>CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use Inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Internal Style Sheet contains rules for webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.  </li>
        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an External CSS Style Sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>When using an External Style Sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want arround the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want arround the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Git & GitHub is a version control software and cloud hosting service that let us keep track of changes we make to our code.</li>
        <li>To access Git use the command line</li>
        <li>Git commands always start with "git" and are used to save and track version of your code.</li>
        <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on without affecting the default branch.</li>
        <li>Our default branch is called "main". We should'nt do any coding directly in the "main" branch.</li>
        <li>To make changes to the main branch. we should create a feature branch.</li>
        <li>A feature branch is a copy of the main branch.</li>
        <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all changes we make to the code while working.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
