      <ul>
        <li>Git & GitHub is a version control software and cloud hosting service that let us keep track of changes we make to our code.</li>
        <li>To access Git use the command line</li>
        <li>Git commands always start with "git" and are used to save and track version of your code.</li>
        <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on without affecting the default branch.</li>
        <li>Our default branch is called "main". We should'nt do any coding directly in the "main" branch.</li>
        <li>To make changes to the main branch. we should create a feature branch.</li>
        <li>A feature branch is a copy of the main branch.</li>
        <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all changes we make to the code while working.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
