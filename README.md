## Description

Welcome to our Pre-work  Study Guide! 

This Study Guide was designed specifically for  boot camp students  who were going through the Pre-work before camp. 
It aimed to assist students in tackling  the wealth of  informations gathered during the Pre-work into a coherent and structured format, making their learning  journey smoother.  

Our  Study Guide contains  notes on an array of topics covered in the Pre-work . From  HTML, CSS, Git, to JavaScript.

During this project, I've learned how to do the following:
* Use Git version control to create a repo and save work.
* Create a basic HTML page using semantic HTML.
* Select and style HTML elements using an external CSS style sheet.
* Identify a JavaScript array and the role of variables in JavaScript.
* Summarize the basics of control flow and conditionals.
* Use a ```for``` loop to complete a task using logical operators.
* Deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.
